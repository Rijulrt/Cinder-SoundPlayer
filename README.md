Cinder-SoundPlayer
==================

Simple class to load and play sounds using Cinder's 0.8.6 new audio API. Features commonly needed functionality like fading volume in and out, panning and moving the playhead to a certain time or percent. The block also includes the utility class SoundManager to easily keep track of all the audio assets in the application.

Includes two samples.

Tested only on Mac OS X but should work in other platforms.
